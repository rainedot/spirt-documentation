## CVar flags

```lua
local e_cvar_flags = {
    none = 0,
    unregistered = bit.lshift(1, 0), -- If this is set, don't add to linked list, etc.
    developmentonly = bit.lshift(1, 1), -- Hidden in released products. Flag is removed automatically if ALLOW_DEVELOPMENT_CVARS is defined.
    gamedll = bit.lshift(1, 2), -- defined by the game DLL
    clientdll = bit.lshift(1, 3), -- defined by the client DLL
    hidden = bit.lshift(1, 4), -- Hidden. Doesn't appear in find or auto complete. Like DEVELOPMENTONLY, but can't be compiled out.
    protected = bit.lshift(1, 5), -- It's a server cvar, but we don't send the data since it's a password, etc.  Sends 1 if it's not bland/zero, 0 otherwise as value
    sponly = bit.lshift(1, 6), -- This cvar cannot be changed by clients connected to a multiplayer server.
    archive = bit.lshift(1, 7), -- set to cause it to be saved to vars.rc
    notify = bit.lshift(1, 8), -- notifies players when changed
    userinfo = bit.lshift(1, 9), -- changes the client's info string
    printableonly = bit.lshift(1, 10), -- This cvar's string cannot contain unprintable characters ( e.g., used for player name etc ).
    gamedll_for_remote_clients = bit.lshift(1, 10), -- When on concommands this allows remote clients to execute this cmd on the server.
    unlogged = bit.lshift(1, 11), -- If this is a FCVAR_SERVER, don't log changes to the log file / console if we are creating a log
    never_as_string = bit.lshift(1, 12), -- never try to print that cvar
    replicated = bit.lshift(1, 13), -- server setting enforced on clients, TODO rename to FCAR_SERVER at some time
    cheat = bit.lshift(1, 14), -- Only useable in singleplayer / debug / multiplayer & sv_cheats
    ss = bit.lshift(1, 15), -- causes varnameN where N == 2 through max splitscreen slots for mod to be autogenerated
    demo = bit.lshift(1, 16), -- record this cvar when starting a demo file
    dontrecord = bit.lshift(1, 17), -- don't record these command in demofiles
    ss_added = bit.lshift(1, 18), -- This is one of the "added" FCVAR_SS variables for the splitscreen players
    release = bit.lshift(1, 19), -- Cvars tagged with this are the only cvars avaliable to customers
    reload_materials = bit.lshift(1, 20), -- If this cvar changes, it forces a material reload
    reload_textures = bit.lshift(1, 21), -- If this cvar changes, if forces a texture reload
    not_connected = bit.lshift(1, 22), -- cvar cannot be changed by a client that is connected to a server
    material_system_thread = bit.lshift(1, 23), -- Indicates this cvar is read from the material system thread
    archive_gameconsole = bit.lshift(1, 24), -- cvar written to config.cfg on the Xbox
    server_can_execute = bit.lshift(1, 28),
    server_cannot_query = bit.lshift(1, 29),
    clientcmd_can_execute = bit.lshift(1, 30), -- IVEngineClient::ClientCmd is allowed to execute this command.
    accessible_from_threads = bit.lshift(1, 25), -- used as a debugging tool necessary to check material system thread convars
}
